# CPRG352 Final Project
*Bryan Meyer*

## Introduction

This is my submission for the SAIT Web Application Development final project. The assignment is to build a fully-functional inventory management web application from scratch using Java. The application will be built using an MVC architecture coupled with a MySQL database. See the [assignment doc](/Project.docx) for more information.

## Functionality

The core functionality of the app includes:
- Authentication
- Registration
- User account management
- Inventory management
- Management of accounts by admins
- Management of categories

The app may also have some additional functionality. 

## Technologies

The app was built using the following technologies:

- Netbeans 12
- Tomcat 8
- Maven
- Java
- JDBC
- MariaDB

## Running the app

To run the app as is, download it to your local machine and run the sql file found in the database package within your local MariaDB client. Once the database has been created, open the project and run it from Netbeans.
